# ExportARFaceGeometry

ExportARFaceGeometry is a simple iOS app that allows you to export the geometry of your face as a Wavefront OBJ file. The app uses ARKit to track your face in real-time, and then generates a 3D model of your face geometry. You can then export this geometry to an OBJ file, which can be used in 3D modeling software or game engines.

## How to use
1. Launch the app on your iPhone or iPad
2. Point the front camera towards your face
3. Wait for the app to detect your face and generate the 3D model
4. Tap the "Export" button to save the model as an OBJ file to the app's Documents directory
5. Connect your device to your computer to access the exported OBJ file

That's it! You can now use the exported OBJ file in your favorite 3D modeling software or game engine.
